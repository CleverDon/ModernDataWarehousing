### Our Hero

We will start with our hero Anton.  He is an automotive engineer by trade and has a particular passion for autonomously controlled vehicles.  As a boy, he had always had a dream to have a car similar to that of K.I.T.T. from his favorite show, Knight Rider.  Using today's technology, he has been able to produce a functional version of the car which he sells to a few people a year who have an excessive disposable income.
